## Disclaimer

This repo is by no means a demonstration of best practices to follow.
This demonstrates the CORS issue amd how to overcome it using backend code.
The principle should be the same regardless of language used.

Please make sure you update **appsettings.json** with the correct values.

```json
  "LeadApi": {
    "ApiKey": "abc-123",
    "BaseUri": "https://base-uri.com",
    "PostUri": "xxx/api/path/post"
  }
```
